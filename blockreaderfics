  ---INFO---
  permablocking reader fics. i dont like them deal with it
  set up to get most anything tagged with reader or /reader or reader/ or /you or you/
  might miss some but that's going to be a small number and more stringent filters are going to get non-reader fics
  (my first go around got everything tagged with anything with "read" anywhere turns out that's lots of words)
