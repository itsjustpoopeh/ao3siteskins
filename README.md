# ao3siteskins
CSS snippets for customizing the archive to taste regardless of platform or browser
i find it easier to actually create the skins on desktop but technically you could do it on mobile as well
Create a site skin and paste in the code. AO3 will strip the comments between /* */ automatically so save them to your own txt files if you want to keep the comments
i like to create a separate site skin for each separate block then add those as parents to my base user skin
eg - i create a blank site skin as my "personal base" skin. then i add reversi or something as a parent, then each of the skin filters
this makes it easier to mix and match and update as necessary
structure:
  Personal Base
    Parents:
    - Major appearance skin - mine is Dyslexia Dark by Electric Alice
    - Block reader fics
    - Block trigger tags
    - Muted users notice
    Etc. I have like a dozen? Seems to work fine so far
