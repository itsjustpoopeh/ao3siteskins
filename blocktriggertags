  /*
  ---INFO---
  Permablock undesired tags sitewide without needing to exclude or save searches
  lines with $ are direct tag references, get those directly from the tag url for accuracy
  lines with * will block any tag with that word in it ("slavery" for instance also should block "Alternate Universe - Slavery" so it doesn't have to reference a URL directly
  this will block these tags across the entire site regardless of fandom by default
  i keep my css blocks in separate txt files so the comments remain
  ao3 strips everything between /* */ when the skin is saved
