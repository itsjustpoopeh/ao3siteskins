  /*
  ---INFO---
  permablocking reader fics. i dont like them deal with it
  set up to get most anything tagged with reader or /reader or reader/ or /you or you/
  might miss some but that's going to be a small number and more stringent filters are going to get non-reader fics
  (my first go around got everything tagged with anything with "read" anywhere in the string turns out that's lots of words)
  you can change or add tags by copying the tag url and taking only the part at the end "/tags/TAG/works"
  it's important to do it this way because tags with a space between the words have special characters (%20) and i, personally, never remember to include that
