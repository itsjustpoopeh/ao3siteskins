  snippet to highlight chosen favorite writers in color of choice
  if you've ever used the fanficnavigator tampermonkey script this does the same thing of highlighting your faves just a few more steps but works on mobile browsers as well
  this is the same code as the old blocking users skin from before the muting feature
  just changing the display none to a colored background
  will color the entire work blurb and any comments those authors leave
  get the profile ID # to add
  change color to whatever works for you, hexcode or common color name works fine, i needed transparency otherwise i couldn't read anything bc of the dark theme i use

.user-PROFILEID,
.user-PROFILEID {
  background: rgba(0, 105, 17, 0.25) !important;
